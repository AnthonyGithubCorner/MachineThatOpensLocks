'Pin C.0 connects to switch one. (SW1)
'Pin C.1 connects to switch one. (SW2)
'Pin C.2 connects to switch one. (SW3)
'Pin B.0 to B.3 connects to transistors that connect to stepper motor coils.
'Pin B.4 connects to Green LED
symbol LED = B.4 'Rename output B.4 ‘LED’
main: ; make a label called ‘main’
if pinC.3 = 1 then flash ; jump if the input is on
goto main ; else loop back around

for flashcount = 1 to 3 ; start a for...next loop
high B.4 ; switch output 4 on
pause 500 ; pause for 1⁄2 a second
low B.4 ; switch output 4 off

next flashcount ; counting the three flashes
for counter = 1to 15 ;Loops through the program 15 times.
